# Practice-Problems
Basic coding problems to help keep me sharp.

1.) Check if a problem is a palindrome. return true if it is a palindrome or false if it is not.
2.) Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

3.)
